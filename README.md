# Data-management-and-visualization
Repository that has additional scripts and notes for the course at Politecnico di Torino

These notes have not been verified by professor, but I will save here some queries and their output.
This will be useful as it is an open-book exam, do not print 1.000 pages when 10 are enough :)
