-- RANK() is useful when we want to rank the results of a query

select city, amount,
rank() over (order by amount desc)
as ranking
FROM `Sales`
where month=12;

-- first all query is executed, then it is sorted by alphabetical order of City
-- assumption: ascending order if not specified

select city, amount,
rank() over (order by amount desc)
as ranking
FROM `Sales`
where month=12
ORDER BY City;

-- GROUP BY EXTENSION
-- ROLLUP

ALTER TABLE `SalesByDay` 
    ADD COLUMN Shop int COMMENT 'Adding a column to connect to shops';
    
ALTER TABLE `SalesByDay` 
    ADD COLUMN YEAR int;
    
select city, T.Month, idShop --in lesson was product key
FROM `SalesByDay` V, `DimCalendar` T, `Shop` S
where V.Month = T.Month
AND
V.Shop = S.idShop
AND
V.Year=2000
--GROUP BY ROLLUP (City, Month, idShop);
GROUP BY City , Month, idShop with ROLLUP; --I'm using MariaDB
